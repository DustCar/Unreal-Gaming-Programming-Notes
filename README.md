# Unreal-Gaming-Programming-Notes

Here will be all of the notes that will be important for me to retain information about gameplay logic, math concepts, and using Unreal Engine 5.2, largely with C++ but with Blueprints.

# Unreal Engine

## Constructing Components
`CreateDefaultSubobject<type>(TEXT("name"))`

A Template function that constructs a component of the specified type in the angle brackets. The parameter in the parantheses would be the name of said subobject. Returns a pointer to the component set as specified type. 

*Ex: CreateDefaultSubobject\<UCapsuleComponent\>(TEXT("Capsule")) --> returns UCapsuleComponent\**

TODO: add general steps, and clean up next few subheaders

### Forward Declaration
Useful when needing a specific class to declare a variable type without including a separate header file. Avoids having to copy loads of code into the file needing the class, but is limited in that it does not allow access to members, use of functions, and constructing objects of the class, making it an incomplete type. To access members/use functions/construct objects, then the header file is needed. 
```
#include ...

class {ClassName}
```
*Note: Best practice to avoid including a lot of header files in header files. Only include header files where needed, mostly in cpp files. Use Forward Declaration for header files for type declaring.*

### Declaring variables for components in header file

Before creating the component, it may need the macro `UPROPERTY()` before the declaration. In the instance that a component is not included as a part of the file's class then Forward Declaration is needed. For example, in an Actor class, _UCapsuleComponent_ needs to be forward declared, while _UStaticMeshComponent_ does not. This is because _UStaticMeshComponent_ is included in the Actor class.

```
UPROPERTY()
(class) ComponentType* VarName;
```

Components declared with a `UPROPERTY()` macro with empty parentheses would have its properties hidden in the Details panel when working on a blueprint derived from the C++ classes. These components would be included in the Engine's _Reflection System_ allowing Garbage Collection (GC) to check if the components is being refrenced or refrencing something before freeing it. Without it, then GC may free a component while using it. **It's best to use the `UPROPERTY()` macro for UObjects and members that are used frequently and that are needed to make the game run properly.**

In order to see the details of the blueprint's components then specifiers are needed within `UPROPERTY()` in order to see and edit the properties in the Details panel in the editor.
- `VisibleAnywhere` : is *visible* in the *bp editor* and *world editor*, but **cannot** be edited.
- `EditAnywhere` : is *visible* and can be *edited* in the *bp editor* and *world editor*.
- `VisibleInstanceOnly` : is **not visible** in the *bp editor*, but is *visible* in the *world editor* when an **INSTANCE** of the blueprint is dragged in.
- `VisibleDefaultsOnly` : is *visibile* in the *bp editor*, but **not visible** in the *world editor*.
- `EditInstanceOnly` : is **not visible/editable** in the *bp editor*, but is *visible/editable* in the *world editor* when an **INSTANCE** is dragged in.
- `EditDefaultsOnly` : is *visibile/editable* in the *bp editor*, but **not** in the *world editor*.

  *Note: For component types, like UStaticMeshComponent, it is best to use VisibleAnywhere to assign a mesh since EditAnywhere would try to change the UStaticMeshComponent pointer itself rather than changing the static mesh only.*

As for exposing components to the Event Graph of the blueprint editor, these parameters would be included within the parentheses:
- `BlueprintReadWrite` : gives access to two nodes in the event graph, which are a getter and a setter for the specified variable.
- `BlueprintReadOnly` : gives access to ONLY the GETTER node for the variable.

*Note: Both parameters above **cannot** be used to expose private members.*

**TODO: Create a section for Unreal Engine macros and move them there!!**

Here are some metadata specifiers for `UPROPERTY()`:

To expose private members for blueprints, use the `meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true")` in UPROPERTY().

To make a float variable a slider, use `meta=(UIMin = 0, UIMax = 1)`.

To organize components within the Details tab, use the `Category = "{title}"` parameter.

### Other Macros
Some other UE macros include:
- `UFUNCTION()`
- `USTRUCT()`
- `UCLASS()`
- `UENUM()`

#### UFUNCTION()
`UFUNCTION()` is similar to `UPROPERTY()` but for functions. It also exposes the function to the _Reflection System_ and has its own specifiers and metadata specifiers.

Just like variables, the `UFUNCTION()` macro has specifiers that allow it to be used in Blueprints.
- `BlueprintAuthorityOnly`: makes function only execute in Blueprint code if running on a machine with network authority.
- `BlueprintCallable`: makes function executable in Blueprints.
- `BlueprintCosmetic`: makes function cosmetic and will not run on dedicated servers.
- `BlueprintImplementableEvent`: makes function implementable in Blueprints.
  - ***Note**: When giving a function this specifier, Unreal expects the function to be made in Blueprints so there is no need to create the function body in C++. _However_, it is still valid to call the function in C++.
- `BlueprintNativeEvent`: gives a function a native implementation, but is designed to be overridden by a Blueprint. Declares an additional function named the same as the main function, but with `_Implementation` added to the end, which is where code should be written. If no Blueprint override is found, the `_Implementation` method is called.
- `BlueprintPure`: The function does not affect the owning object in any way and can be executed in a Blueprint or Level Blueprint graph. By default, a _BlueprintCallable_ const function would be exposed as a Pure function. To keep a function const, but **not** pure, use `BlueprintPure=false`. Be cautious using Pure functions for non-trivial functions as they do not cache their results. This can lead to major overhead and unexpected outputs or crashes. It is good practice to avoid outputting array properties in Blueprint pure functions. see [this article](https://raharuu.github.io/unreal/blueprint-pure-functions-complicated/) for more info on Blueprint Pure Functions.

### Creating your own components for internal details (i.e. Health, Currency, Stats)
*Note: I'm sure the Gameplay Ability System can easily accomplish this too but this intentially skips GAS just to cover different cases.*
This is best done using the *Actor Component* class, rather than *Scene Component*, as a base since there is no need for transform or attachments.

Once the class is created, it automatically has a UCLASS macro that allows it to be used in Blueprints, so if needed then you can easily just add your new component to any blueprint, if you don't want to declare it in C++.

The way to add this component in another C++ class is just like how it is stated in this section, using `CreateDefaultSubobject<>()` and declaring its definition.

## Unreal Enhanced Input System (EIS)
Before starting, make sure that the Enhanced Input Plugin is enabled under the *Edit->Plugins* menu. After restarting editor, change the default input classes within *Edit->Project Settings*. Go to the input section under **Engine** and look for Default Classes. Set *Default Player Input Class* to *EnhancedPlayerInput* and set *Default Input Component Class* to *EnhancedInputComponent*.

Make sure that the plugin is included within the .uproject file (name is "EnhancedInput") and within the .Build.cs file (add "EnhancedInput" to PublicDependencyModuleNames line.

Useful Console Commands:
- showdebug enhancedinput

### Main Concepts
- **Input Actions (IA)** : Link between EIS and project code. Separate from raw input and focuses on its current state, returning an input value based on three independent floating-point axes.
- **Input Mapping Contexts (IMC)** : Maps user inputs to IAs and can be dynamically added, removed, or prioritized for each user. Can be applied one or more times through a local player's Enhanced Input Local Player Subsystem.
- **Modifiers** : Adjusts the value of raw input coming from user's devices. IMCs can have any number of modifiers associated with each raw input for an IA. Examples: Dead zones, input smoothing. Custom modifiers can also be created.
- **Triggers** : Uses post-Modifier input values, or output magnitudes of other IAs, to determine whether an IA should activate. Any IA can have one or more Triggers for each input.

### Using/Setting up EIS using C++

**TODO: Clean up notes and add photos**

original article: <https://nightails.com/2022/10/16/unreal-engine-enhanced-input-system-in-c>

After ensuring EIS is added and enabled, first task would be to set up the IMC within the character header and establishing SetupPlayerInputComponent in the cpp file.
 - add a `UInputMappingContext*`, with `UPROPERTY(EditDefaults, BPReadOnly)` as the macro, as a protected member in *Character.h*. You may need to forward declare.
 - in the cpp file, set up SetupPlayerInputComponent. If anything is default set, other than `Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent`, then remove. We'll get back to it later on, for now is just setup.
   1. Create an `APlayerController*` var and get player controller using `GetController()`. Make sure to `Cast<APlayerController>()` to make sure you are retrieving an `APlayerController` object.
   2. Create a `UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem*` var and get enhanced input local player subsystem from _Local Player_ from player controller using `ULocalPlayer::GetSubsystem<UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem>()`.
   3. Clear mappings using `ClearAllMappings()` then add the Input Mapping context from header file with `AddMappingContext()` and player index 0.

_*Note: Make sure to add `#include EnhancedInputSubsystems.h` and `#include InputMappingContext.h` to the Character cpp file._

Next is to set up the IAs. This could be done individually by creating separate `UInputAction*` variables but would become tedious with more actions. 
For better management, use a config file to hold multiple actions. This config file would subclass **DataAsset** and can hold as many actions as wanted.

After creating the **InputConfig** file, make sure to add `#include "InputAction.h"` in the header file. Then add all necessary/wanted *UInputActions* as **public** members with the preferred properties of *EditDefaultsOnly* and *BlueprintReadOnly*. 
Then, add the config file as a protected member of the Character class, just like the IMC from earlier.

Now we go back to the *SetupPlayerInputComponent* function to bind functions to the actions listed in the header file.
To do so:
 1. Get the *EnhancedInputComponent* by casting it from the *PlayerInputComponent*
 2. Bind the actions to the functions that would be made soon using *BindAction*.

*Note: Make sure to add `#include "EnhancedInput/Public/EnhancedInputComponent.h"` and `#include "*ConfigData.h"` as headers.*

Finally, declare the input functions that were bounded to earlier in the header file and then create the functions in the cpp file.
 - When declaring the functions, it should should be **void**.
 - For functions that require an input value, like for movement or anything vector based, it must have a ***const** FInputActionValue&* as a parameter
Within the cpp file, make sure to add `#include "InputActionValue.h"` as a header.

**The input functions that are bounded are the main core of functionality. Whatever is placed in those functions will run whenever the input is achieved.**

*Note: When using the Value parameter in the action functions, Value itself doesn't do much. It is a struct and has get methods that you can use to actually get an input action value. i.e., Value.Get<FVector2D>() returns a 2D Vector Struct that has X and Y values which can be used to determine that there is input.*

## General notes for writing code for Input Action functions
### Pawns and movement
When adding inputs for *Pawns*, especially for movement, it is important to note that *Pawns* **DO NOT** have a movement component that automatically handle the input and move.

To move a *Pawn* with inputs, there are two ways (AFAIK on March 9th, 2024):
- Move the *Pawn* using its location:
  Simple (maybe naive) way:
  1. Within your move function, Create an `FVector` variable that holds a zero vector.
  2. Use `Value.Get<FVector2D>()` and a dot operator to grab the X (A and D) or Y (W and S) input action value.
  3. Assign the value to whatever direction you need the pawn to go to the variable you made on step 1. i.e. VectorVariable.X = `Value.Get<FVector2D>()` -> moves in X direction
  4. Use `AddActorLocalOffset()` and pass the vector variable in to move each tick. *Note: use local offset to move in the direction of the pawn and not with the world axis.*
     
  Using the above method creates very slow, and inconsistent, movement since the amount of movement is set with the value of the input action (1.0) and is based on framerate.
  To fix this, it is best to scale the value that is being assigned by a Speed variable and DeltaTime. i.e. `Value * Speed * DeltaTime`.
  - The Speed variable can be a private member that is a float
  - Since the function is not used within Tick then it is likely that it does not have access to DeltaTime yet. To access DeltaTime, use `UGameplayStatics::GetWorldDeltaSeconds(this)`.

- Add the *Floating Pawn Movement* to *Pawn* BP and use *AddMovementInput* as you would with *Characters*:
  1. Within the move function, use `Value.Get<FVector2D>()` and a dot operator to grab the X (A and D) or Y (W and S) input action value.
  2. Get the forward vector of the pawn using `GetActorForwardVector()`.
  3. Use `AddMovementInput()` and pass in the Forward vector, then the value.

  _*Note: `AddMovementInput()` does not need to be multiplied by DeltaTime and a speed since it already accounts for framerate._

## Creating a Player Pawn/Character
Some general notes on using C++ to create classes for player pawns/characters and how to use it in BPs.

### Pawn vs. Character
<ins>Pawn:</ins>
- Anything that a player can possess
- Can be controlled by the player
- Does not have to be a "character", can be an object
- Does not inherently have movement, as noted in [Pawns and movement](#Pawns-and-movement)

BP children:
- Bare bones, only includes DefaultSceneRoot

<ins>Character:</ins>
- It itself is a pawn
- Includes character-like Movement
- Includes Nav Mesh movement

BP children:
- Includes Capsule Component, with Arrow and Mesh component
- Includes Character Movement component

### Taking/Dealing Damage, Character Specific
By character specific, it means that it is not as general as the Delegate Event version (explained in [this section](#Damage-events)), in which that one uses a separate component to handle health.

For character specific, we will be using the `AActor::TakeDamage()` function that takes in a `DamageEvent` var and adding a variable that holds health **ON** the character class. There are multiple subtypes of _DamageEvent_, two most common ones are `FPointDamageEvent` and `FRadialDamageEvent`.

Function: `AActor::TakeDamage(float DamageAmount, struct FDamageEvent const& DamageEvent, class AController* EventInstigator, AActor* DamageCauser)`

- _EventInstigator_ is the AController* of the Actor that owns the Actor dealing the damage (i.e. owner of gun)

<ins>Guns or single point weapons:</ins>

Damage event: `FPointDamageEvent`

These damage events have constructors that would be used to establish the damage. The constructor with params is `SampleEvent(float InDamage, const FHitResult& InHitInfo, FVector const& InShotDirection, TSubclassOf<UDamageType> InDamageTypeClass)`

TODO: insert reference photo

Raycasting would most commonly be used with this function so you should have a `FHitResult` var that you would use to pass in as a param. You will also be using the hit result var to get the actor that is being hit (using `HitResultVar->GetActor()`).

So first check if hit actor is null, if not then create the DamageEvent, then call `TakeDamage()` with the hit actor like `HitActor->TakeDamage()`

To make the character actually take damage then we would override the `TakeDamage()` function to edit the character's health information. Since `TakeDamage()` is a virtual method then it can be overridden by using the _override_ keyword on the function in our character header and cpp file. Once done then we can do whatever we need to do in TakeDamage() and use the `InDamage` value to decrease the character's health and effectively "take damage".

## POVs
Notes for different character POVs

### Third Person POV
#### Camera Set Up
For simple camera following player set up, in the C++ file for the Player pawn/character do:

1. Create a `USpringArmComponent` variable using the steps from the [Constructing Components](#Constructing-components) section, then use `SetupAttachment()` to attach it to `RootComponent`.
2. Create a `UCameraComponent` variable using the same steps, then attach that to the spring arm component.
3. In the BP editor for the player pawn BP, edit the angle, distance, and location of the spring arm to your liking.

It is good to use a _Spring Arm Component_ with the Camera because it prevents the camera from phasing through walls and gives the camera a set path to follow if the Spring Arm gets compressed.

_*Note: Usually just doing these steps would make the camera follow the player's avatar with no lag, meaning that the avatar would always look like it's in the middle of the screen and the surroundings are what moves._

To make the camera not as snappy, you must enable _Camera Lag_ and _Camera Rotation Lag_ in the Details tab of the **Spring Arm component**.

#### Useful Functions
Functions that can be useful for 3rd person that I don't have a section for

- `AController::GetPlayerViewPoint(&FVector Location, &FRotator Rotator)`: Returns location and rotation of the player's viewpoint. Useful for aiming the 3rd person character using the viewport.

## Line Tracing
A method of Raycasting that performs a collision trace (check) along a line and returns the first object that the trace hits or returns true if a hit is found. Raycasting is very effective for aiming using the player's viewpoint, 1st person or 3rd person. Helps in determining if a player, or other actor, is actually looking at something.

There are multiple types of Raycasting and it includes:
- `UWorld::LineTraceSingleByChannel(struct FHitResult& OutHit,const FVector& Start,const FVector& End,ECollisionChannel TraceChannel)`: Traces a ray that returns the first hit if blocking hit is found by the specified _Trace Channel_.
- `UWorld::LineTraceSingleByObjectType(struct FHitResult& OutHit,const FVector& Start,const FVector& End,const FCollisionObjectQueryParams& ObjectQueryParams)`: Traces a ray that returns the first hit if blocking hit matches _Object Type_.
- `UWorld::LineTraceSingleByProfile(struct FHitResult& OutHit, const FVector& Start, const FVector& End, FName ProfileName)`: Traces a ray that returns the first hit if blocking hit matches _Profile_ description.

There are also other versions of the three functions mentioned above, such as:
- `LineTraceTestBy*(const FVector& Start, const FVector& End, {condition})` versions: Traces a ray and returns true if blocking hit matches.
- `LineTraceMultiBy*(TArray<struct FHitResult>& OutHits, const FVector& Start, const FVector& End, {condition)` versions: Traces a ray and returns a list of the objects that matches the conditions.

<ins>Trace Channel Raycasting:</ins>
When using Trace Channel Raycasting, there are preset collision channels available for use already (Visibility and Camera), but you can also create a new Trace Channel that you can modify its Trace profile in the presets without breaking the existing Trace profiles.

To create a new Trace Channel:
- Go to _Project Settings->Engine->Collision_
- Under _Trace Channels_, click _New Trace Channel_, give it a name and its _Default Response_
- Under _Presets_, open any of the project profiles and you should see your new trace channel under _Trace Type_. Then just set how the channel should react to specified profiles.

***BIG NOTE: When trying to use the new channel with the Raycast functions, there is no ECollisionChannel with the name of our new Trace Channel like the presets.**

In order to find out what ECollisionChannel our new channel uses, you must open up the `DefaultEngine.ini` file in the `%PROJECT_PATH%/Config` folder. The file can be opened as a .txt file. Once opened CTRL+F to find your trace channel's name. To know what ECollisionChannel, its name is of the form `ECC_GameTraceChannel{num}`.

There is a limit of 18 custom channels and it usually goes by the order in which new channels are added (unless channels are removed) so the first custom channel should be `ECC_GameTraceChannel1`, but always make sure check the file first.

### Ignoring Actors/Components
In addition to the params mentioned earlier, there is an additional parameter after _ECollisionChannel_ that takes in an `FCollisionQueryParams` variable. This struct holds any extra queries that you would want to add to the trace. This includes what actors and/or components to ignore.

To implement the parameter:
1. create a `FCollisionQueryParams` var called "Params".
2. Use the dot operator and find the functions `AddIgnoredActor(AActor* InActor)` or `AddIgnoredComponent(UPrimitiveComponent* InIgnoredComponent)`.
3. Pass in the respective actor or component to be ignored.
4. Add _Params_ to the LineTrace function call as the parameter after ECollisionChannel.

## Character Meshes
The main type of mesh that characters will most often use would be a **Skeletal Mesh**. These meshes allow designers to connect the mesh to a **Skeleton** asset to be used for animating the characters movements. 

### Skeletons
A **Skeleton** asset is also good for attaching other Actors/objects to the character via sockets, which makes them also able to be animated or used in some way. Anything that is attached to the Skeleton gets placed in a hierarchy similar to scene hierarchy called the **Skeleton Tree**. The Skeleton Tree holds two types of children, _Bones_ and _Sockets_.

#### Setting Sockets
To setup a Socket for Actor Attachment:
1. Go to Skeleton Tree of character and find the bone to attach the socket to.
2. Right-click on the bone and `Add Socket` (Rename if needed)
3. Go to C++ file, use the function `AttachToComponent()` with the actor you want to attach. i.e. `SimpleActor->AttachToComponent()`
4. Use `SetOwner()` with the same actor to establish the ownership of the attached actor to the current class you are in.

Function: `AttachToComponent(USceneComponent* Parent, const FAttachmentTransformRules& AttachmentRules, FName SocketName)`
- Attaches the Actor to the component with _Socketname_
- AttachmentRules are transform rules that the Actor would follow and has four preset options: `KeepRelativeTransform`, `KeepWorldTransform`, `SnapToTargetNotIncludingScale`, `SnapToTargetIncludingScale`

#### Hiding Bones
Sometimes there will be a moment where you want to hide a Bone that is part of a Skeleton Tree, be it from a preset character or to hide a placeholder. One C++ function that can accomplish that is the `HideBoneByName()` function.

Function: `USkinnedMeshComponent::HideBoneByName(FName BoneName, EPhysBodyOp PhysBodyOption)`
- a `TEXT()` macro can usually be passed in for _BoneName_
- `EPhysBodyOp` has three options: `PBO_None`, `PBO_Term`, `PBO_MAX`

## Objects via Actors
### Creating Objects
The most common parent class for creating a new object, especially one that will be used in the world, would be the _Actor_ class. It is probably best to also create a BP deriving the class so that you can see changes you add to it after closing the editor and re-building the project.

One major thing to note about BPs deriving from a C++ class is that they do **NOT** have a _Default Scene Root_ component. When adding any new component to the C++ class, the highest component in that hierarchy would become the root component.

So it is best to create a `USceneComponent*` var in the C++ class and set that as the root so that the Actor will have a transform and a root component.

### Spawning Actors
TODO: Add photos

To spawn an actor, Unreal has a C++ function called `UWorld::SpawnActor<>()` that is part of the UWorld class and is a template function. In order to call this function, you must have a `UWorld` variable, so it is common to use `GetWorld()->SpawnActor<>()` to get a UWorld var then to use the function.

Function: `SpawnActor<T>(UClass* Class, FVector Location, FRotator Rotation)`
- SpawnActor() has multiple overloadds but these params are most common when simply spawning in an actor.
- Since it takes in a _UClass*_ you must have a `TSubclassOf<T>` class variable of the type of actor you want to spawn.
- When creating the `TSubclassOf<T>` var, make sure to add a `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly)`, so that the class can be assigned on the BP and so that the class doesn't change during play.
- This function returns a variable of type _T_ so make sure to assign a variable (local/global) so that you can do something with the spawned actor.

Once set up, make sure to open the BP of the class that is spawning the actor and assign the **BLUEPRINT** version of the actor to the main BP, not the actual class.

### Actor Ownership
Actors actually do **NOT** have a hierarchy between each other like the Scene Components do. Instead they have an Ownership dynamic in which an Actor can own another and that can affect how certain events can turn out (i.e. who damages what, whose inventory to focus on). This is especially true for Delegate Events like _OnTakeAnyDamage()_.

## AI Enemies
### Setup
Setup for applying AI to Character BPs you add into the world that is not the player.

1. Create an AI Controller C++ class (To find the class, check "All Classes" and type for it).
2. Create a BP deriving off of the new C++ class.
3. Open the character/pawn BP that you want the AI controller to use.
4. Go to the details panel and find "AI Controller Class" under the _Pawn_ category, change the class to the new BP AI controller class you made.

### Simple AI Aiming
<ins>Functions for Aiming:</ins>

- `AAIController::SetFocalPoint(FVector NewFocus, EAIFocusPriority::Type InPriority = EAIFocusPriority::Gameplay)`
- `AAIController::SetFocus(AActor* NewFocus, EAIFocusPriority::Type InPriority = EAIFocusPriority::Gameplay)`
- `AAIController::ClearFocus(EAIFocusPriority::Type InPriority)`: used to clear any focuses.

These functions tells the AI to look at a certain point or at a certain actor. Good for when the enemy is idle or when player gets an Enemy's attention.

### Simple AI Line of Sight
Function: `AAIController::LineOfSightTo(const AActor* Other, FVector ViewPoint = FVector(ForceInit), bool bAlternateChecks = false)`

This is a function that returns a bool on whether the _Other_ actor is in the line of sight of the AI actor. Unreal already covers where the "eyes" are on a character so no need to specify the view point on a character.

_**Note**: This function allows the AI to see you even if you are behind its back. It will see you unless you are obstructed from its view. To have a LOS that is more configurable with its view radius, use an AIPerceptionComponent._

### Simple AI Movement
Before an AI can move, we have to first tell it where it can and cannot go. This can be done with a **Nav Mesh Bounds Volume**. The Nav Mesh Volume would map out the areas of the map that the AI can create a path on, which essentially allows it to know where obstacles are. It is essential because AI Controllers include a _PathFollowingComponent_ that looks for a NavMesh and then creates a path to follow. It also means that there is no need to make a path following algorithm from scratch.

<ins>Move Functions:</ins>

- `AAIController::MoveToLocation(const FVector& Dest, float AcceptanceRadius = -1)`
- `AAIController::MoveToActor(AActor* Goal, float AcceptanceRadius = -1)`: The goal destination for this function will always update to make sure AI is at destination. So if placed in Tick(), AI would continuously follow Actor.
- `Acceptance Radius` is the number of units from the goal destination until the AI stops following.

_Note: There many more params but they have default values and these are the main ones that are needed._

These functions move the character to the specified location or actor and stops when within the acceptance radius. 

Other Functions:
- `AAIController::StopMovement()`: Function that stops the current movement the controller is performing

## Behavior Trees
_These trees are tools separate from Blueprints, and also do not have a true C++ class, but can be interfaced in C++._

_Using a Behavior Tree means that the C++ code above would not be used and instead the functionality would be in the Behavior Trees. A BehaviorTree var would be attached to the AIController C++ class to link them._

A tree graph that holds different behaviors for an AI. It helps with setting up more complex behaviors and making movement between them more natural. Linked with a Blackboard asset.

**Blackboard**: "memory" of the AI. Similar to Animation System, where we set up properties to let the AI know what to do and when to do things. Properties held in the Blackboard are called "Keys".

<ins>Setup:</ins>

1. In the Editor, go to Content Browser and under "Artificial Intelligence", click on "Behavior Tree" (Names prefixed with "BT").
2. Under the same category, click on "Blackboard" and create a new asset (Names prefixed with "BB").
3. Open the Behavior Tree and in the Details tab look for the "Blackboard Asset" dropdown. Link it with your new Blackboard asset. Close the editor.
4. Open the AIController C++ file and add a new `UBehaviorTree` private variable. Set it _EditAnywhere_. Save and Recompile.
5. Open the AIController BP and attach the BT asset to the UBehaviorTree variable.

To see if it is connected properly and running, you have to run the BT, which you have to do anyways. To do so:
- Open the AIController C++ file and in _BeginPlay()_, first check if the UBehaviorTree is not null, then call the function `RunBehaviorTree(SampleBTVariable)`
- Recompile, open the BT asset and add a sequence node.
- Hook it up to Root, play the game, eject, then open the BT asset.
- If the Root is highlighted then the BT is working properly.

### Blackboard Keys
Properties that are saved to be used by the Behavior Tree.

Just like the Behavior Tree, the Blackboard component can also be interfaced in C++. Using the newly created Behavior Tree variable from earlier, we can use the function `AIController::GetBlackboardComponent()` to get the Blackboard component to work with. Either save it in a variable or re-use the function.

Now to actually set some Keys for the Blackboard through C++, you must:
1. Open the AIController C++ file where the Behavior Tree was set up.
2. Get the Blackboard component associated with BT using the function above.
3. Use the `->` operator and find the `SetValueAs{type}(const FName& KeyName, F{type} Value)` functions. Pick based on which value you want to set _KeyName_ as.
4. Pass in the value you want to set _KeyName_ as.

After that, build and in the editor go to your Blackboard Asset. In the BB editor, on the left side, create a new Key and name it the exact same as the name you gave it in the C++ file. Make sure that the typing is correct.

To check if it is working, compile then play and eject to the Blackboard then checking if the new Key has a value set.

To clear a value you have set, you can use the `ClearValue(const FName& KeyName)` function to do so.

### Setting up Behaviors
As seen from the set up, the behavior tree has a tree graph with a node called "ROOT". This "ROOT" node can only have one child node, so trying to pull another child node would break the link with its initial child and link with the new one. However, nodes after the root node can have multiple children.

To create a behavior on the tree, there are two types of nodes that we need to accomplish this, _Composite_ nodes and _Task_ nodes.
- **Composites**: nodes that determine how child nodes will be executed.
- **Tasks**: nodes that actually performs actions.

So to create a new task behavior, first choose what type of _Composite_ node you want. Then drag off the composite node and select what tasks you want the AI to perform. This node can have as many child nodes that you want, same goes for its child nodes. When adding nodes, it is possible to use composite nodes as children to create nested behaviors. Not all child nodes have to be _Tasks_

#### Composites
There are 3 types of Composite nodes:
- **Selector**: Executes child nodes from left to right and stops executing when one of its children _succeeds_. If one child succeeds, the Selector succeeds.
- **Sequence**: Executes child nodes from left to right and stops executing when one of its children _FAILS_. If all children succeed, the Sequence succeeds.
- **Simple Parallel**: A node that runs a main task while it is running other nodes in the backgraound. Finished when the main task finishes.

### Decorators
Add-ons for nodes that change how the node will be ran. They are essentially requirements that have to be met before a node can be ran. Decorators can be used on both Composites and Tasks.

There are multiple options, including:
- _Blackboard_: Decorator node that bases its condition on a BB key. If the Key is set then execute, else do not.
- _Conditional Loop_: Decorator node that loops node execution as long as the condition is satisfied.
- _TimeLimit_: Decorator node that aborts execution after a set time. Resets the timer when the node becomes relevant again.
- etc...

To add Decorators, right-click on the node you want, and select "Add Decorator".

#### Flow Control
With Decorators, there are additional options that can affect how the BT flows. These options can be found under **Flow Control**. It is in the details tab of a Decorator when it is clicked on. Most decorator nodes have these and it has a setting called "Obsever aborts".

**Observer Aborts** has four options:
- _None_: Default. Do nothing.
- _Self_: Abort the attached node.
- _Lower Priority_: Lowers the priority of other nodes within the same level of the attached node when the condition is satisfied for the current node.
- _Both_: Does both _Self_ and _Lower Priority_ modes when their respective conditions occur.

### Tasks
List of different tasks I have used and what they do:
- **Move To**: Moves actor to another actor or a set Blackboard Key location.
- **Wait**: Waits for a specified amount of time.

### Creating Custom Tasks in C++
Before creating a new C++ class, first go to the build file of your project (suffixed with .build.cs) and add `"GameplayTasks"` to the `PublicDependcyModuleNames` list. This is to avoid the error the compiler would have if you were to create a Behavior Tree Task (BTT) class without it.

After reopening the editor, create a new C++ class and in "All Classes" look for "BTTask" classes. This would show all the different types of BT Task nodes that you can subclass off of. The most generic class is the `BTTaskNode` class.

Once you have chosen a node to subclass and the files have been created. First thing I would suggest to do is set the name of your node to be readable in the editor.

In the header file:
- Create a constructor with no params

In the cpp file:
- Create the definition if not done already.
- Set a new name using `NodeName = TEXT("New Name");`

To implement the functionality of the node, we need to use the `ExecuteTask()` function from the `UBTNode` parent class.

Function header: `virtual EBTNodeResult::Type ExecuteTask(UBehaviorTreeComponent& OwnerComp, uint8* NodeMemory) override;`

Create the definition and make sure that the `Super::ExecuteTask(OwnerComp, NodeMemory)` function is included. Depending on your IDE (I use Rider), it may have the option to create the definition for you and include the Super line with it.

The Super function itself returns a `EBTNodeResult::Succeeded` enum so you can just implement the task's functionality then return `Super::ExecuteTask(OwnerComp, NodeMemory)` at the end.

#### Using the Pawn in Task
To be able to use the pawn:
1. Get the owner of the BT component using `GetAIOwner()`. Check if nullptr.
2. Use `GetPawn()` with -> operator on `GetAIOwner()` to get pawn.
3. Cast the type of Pawn you are trying to get. Check if nullptr.

Nodes I have subclassed:
- `BTTaskNode`: Base BTTask node with no special properties.
- `BTTask_BlackboardBase`: a BTTaskNode with the option of Blackboard key options coded in.

### Behavior Tree Services
BTServices are add-on functionality that runs every tick or every so often when the node, or any path under the node is being used. They are different from _Simple Parallel_ in that they work with the node its on and do not affect other nodes.

Adding a Service is similar to Adding a Decorator. Same with creating a custom BTService in C++. The only difference this time is that you are searching for `BTService` classes

BTServices are great for keeping track of BB values, setting or clearing them, and could be an alternative to using the AIController C++ class for it. It is more customizable when it comes to using Tick since you can change how often a service can run, rather than just always running on each frame.

## Interacting with World Editor components in C++
Don't know yet if that's a good name for this section but I'll roll with it until I find a better name (07/05/24)

### Getting an array of Actors from World
As the title suggets, this a section describing how to get an array of a certain type of Actor from the World.

This can be done with the method `UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass()` from the _Gameplay Statics_ class folder.
- With params: `UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass(const UObject* WorldContextObject, TSubclassOf<AActor> ActorClass, TArray<AActor*>& OutActors)`
- _ActorClass_ could be any `UClass*` type.
  - When passing in a UClass, it is best to pass in its static class, i.e. `AExampleClass::StaticClass()`.
- _OutActors_ is an out parameter that will be the array that is returned.

## Using C++ Functions in Blueprint
When trying to use your C++ class functions in Blueprints, you first must add any of the Blueprint UFUNCTION() macros to expose the functions to BPs.

Once made sure, then within the event graph of your BP, use "Try Get Pawn/Actor/etc." to get the base class of your C++ class (i.e. Pawn for a Character). We then "Cast To" whatever the name of the C++ class you are trying to use functions from. That should be the general way to use functions from C++, although I'm sure there are other ways to get the class other than Cast.

## Projectiles
### Projectile Movement
Three ways to implement projectile movement:
- Manually set location/rotation. Implemented using Tick.
- Add an impulse. Enable/Use physics/physics system.
- Attach a movement component. Unreal has an already built Projectile Movement Component.

**Using UProjectileMovementComponent**

documentation: <https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/UProjectileMovementComponent?application_version=5.2>

include: `#include "GameFramework/ProjectileMovementComponent.h"`

To add the component is the same as any other component:
1. Add pointer declaration in header with UPROPERTY() for editor usage.
2. Use CreateDefaultSubobject<>() in cpp to construct the component.
3. Set any variables/attachments.

## Timers
Managed by _Timer Managers_, which are of struct `FTimerManager`.

A global, as well as World, Timer Manager exists on the Game Instance object and on each World.

To call functions from the _World Timer Manager_, use `GetWorldTimerManager().*`.

Common Functions to use with Timers include:
- `SetTimer()`: sets a delay/timer for a call back function
  - Usual Overload: `SetTimer(Timer Handle, User Object, CallBack Function, Timer Rate, Loop Bool, Beginning Delay)`
  - Timer Delegate Overload: `SetTimer(Timer Handle, Timer Delegate, Timer Rate, Loop Bool, Beginning Delay)`
  - No Delegate Overload: `SetTimer(Timer Handle, Timer Rate, Loop Bool, Beginning Delay)`
- `IsTimerActive()`: checks if a timer is currently counting

<ins>Timer Delegate</ins>: To create a `FTimerDelegate` variable, use `FTimerDelegate::CreateUObject(User Object, Callback Function, Function Params)`

## Delegates (Events)
*Occurs with UPrimitiveComponents (inherited classes too).*

### Hit Events
Delegate `OnComponentHit`: Event called when a component hits (or is hit by) something solid.
- Returns a struct called `FComponentHitSignature`.
- Considered a **Multicast Delegate**.

`ObjectComponent->OnComponentHit.AddDynamic(User Object, Callback Function)`: used to add functions to the invocation list

Common callback function(s) used with hit events:
```
UFUNCTION()
void OnHit(UPrimitiveComponent* HitComp, AActor* OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, FVector NormalImpulse, const FHitResult& Hit);
```
- Allows for access to the other actor/component for different on hit scenarios. Includes affect based on physics and information for hit result.

### Damage Events
Another way to deal/take damage. Usually best paired with a component that deals with health (specifically for OnTakeAnyDamage(), ApplyDamage() can be from anyone).

Generated by `UGampelayStatics::ApplyDamage(AActor* DamagedActor, float BaseDamage, AController* EventInstigator, AActor* DamageCauser, TSubclassOf<UDamageType> DamageTypeClass)`

`Actor->OnTakeAnyDamage.AddDynamic(User Object, Callback Function)`: used to add functions to the invocation list

Delegate `OnTakeAnyDamage`: Event called when the actor takes damage in any way.
- Returns a struct called `FTakeAnyDamageSignature`
- Considered a **Multicast Delegate**

Common callback function(s) used with damage events:
```
UFUNCTION()
void DamageTaken(AActor* DamagedActor, float Damage, const UDamageType* DamageType, AController* Instigator, AActor* DamageCauser);
```
- Applies damage to the actor getting damaged with damage value and type.

### Delegate Notes
**Multicast Delegate**: A delegate where multiple functions can be bound to it and respond to that event. 
- Functions are added to an *Invocation List*. 
- *Broadcast* to functions in *Invocation List* when something happens for response.

## Progamming GameMode Class
### AGameModeBase vs. AGameMode
AGameModeBase is one tier above AGameMode, meaning that AGameMode subclasses AGameModeBase. This makes AGameModeBase more general than AGameMode.

**AGameModeBase** defines the game being played and includes:
- Rules of the game
- Win conditions
- What actors exist/Who enters the game
When dealing with server-client games, it is only instantiated server-side and never exists on a client.

**AGameMode** is more suited for match-based multiplayer games:
- Deals with spawn points
- Handles match state

When deciding to create a custom GameMode class, it is then better to use AGameModeBase since that is really where the rules of the game are being defined.

### Making Multiple GameModes based on one GameModeBase class
As stated previously, it is best to start with a GameModeBase as it is more generic, allowing you to create a fully custom mode. This gives us the possibility to subclass this GameModeBase class and create multiple different game modes with different rules by using [virtual functions](#Virtual-Methods).

With the use of virtual functions, we can have one, or multiple, function(s) in the base GameModeBase class and any new subclassing GameMode would be able to override that function and implement its own functionality. This also allows our code to use Casting to accept any game modes as long as it has the base class GameMode.

Example:
```
// Base GameModeBase .h
class ASampleGameModeBase
{
public:
    virtual void DoSomething(APawn* Pawn);
};

// Foo GameMode .h
class FooGameMode : public ASampleGameModeBase
{
public:
    void DoSomething(APawn* Pawn) override
    {
        std::cout << "Foo Mode active\n";
    };
};

// Bar GameMode .h
class BarGameMode : public ASampleGameModeBase
{
public:
    void DoSomething(APawn* Pawn) override
    {
        std::cout << "Bar Mode active\n";
    };
};
```
```
// some function
   ASampleGameModeBase* GameMode = GetWorld()->GetAuthGameMode<ASampleGameModeBase>();
   GameMode->DoSomething(nullptr);
```
If we had a variable of the base class and called the function `DoSomething()`, depending on what GameMode is set in the project settings, the respective functions would be called. _"Foo Mode Active"_ for **FooGameMode** and _"Bar Mode Active"_ for **BarGameMode**.

Knowing this, we can then make multiple types of GameModes based off of one GameModeBase class we setup, as long as the virtual functions are set up correctly.

### Dealing with multiple actors in a game mode function
In the case where you have a function that passes in a generic actor, it is possible to use Casting in a conditional as a way to check what the actor being passed in is. This is especially useful for enemy actors, which you can have a large number of. 

Example: `if (AEnemyActor* BadActor = Cast<AEnemyActor>(PassedActor)) { do this }`

It is effective when the enemies are of the same type but the main takeaway is that it can lower the number of conditionals you need for that function since you do not need to be too specific.

## UI Widgets
Components that allow me to project 3D UI elements to the player's screen. The **Widget** Component is a 3D instance of a Widget Blueprint (WBP) that makes the WBP interactable in the game world.

### Widget Blueprints
Contains the UI design elements of a widget. It is the main place where I can take functionality and gameplay elements and display it to the UI.

**User Widget** will be the primary widget blueprint that can be used for most UI widgets. For more specific or complex widgets, you can use **Slate**, although it's more advanced.

Find `User Widget` by: _Right clicking in CB->User Interface->Widget Blueprint->User Widget_

### Widget Blueprint Editor
When working with Widget Blueprints, Unreal opens up a Widget Blueprint Editor which is slightly different from the regular Blueprint editor.

TODO: insert image of WBPE

<ins>Switching between _Designer_ and _Editor_</ins>

The graph that is shown first is the **Designer** editor of the WBPE. On the top right, you can see that there are two buttons, Designer and Graph. Clicking on the _Graph_ option would switch the Designer editor screen to the Event Graph editor like the Blueprint Editor.

TODO: more details on designer editor

#### Dealing with Widgets in WBPE
In the WBPE, it includes a hierarchy with the Widget Blueprint as the root widget component, similar to how the Blueprint Editor has a hierarchy with RootComponent as root.

One very important aspect of the editor is how any child component of the root widget component can be turned into a variable that can be used in Blueprints. To do so, you need to click on the component you want to make a variable, and in the _Details_ panel on the right, click on the checkbox `Is Variable` that is next to the name box.

TODO: add photo reference

This allows you to make the UI dynamic and ties it to your game functionality.

### Interfacing Widgets with C++
One major thing to note when using C++ with UI Widgets is that the main file that you will be implementing the use of the widgets should be in the **PlayerController** files. This is because PlayerController is what the player is actually using. Meaning that if you want to open a menu, or press buttons on a main menu, that does not possess a Pawn then the PlayerController would be the place to put the UI since no possession is needed.

Additionally, keeping any HUD and UI elements all in one place is much easier to handle than spreading it out and making a ton of cross class referencing. The PlayerController is also important in communicating with the GameMode of your level, it is most commonly used as an intermediate bewteen the GameMode and your HUD/UI. So anything that the HUD or UI might need from GameMode, it can talk to the PlayerController to obtain that thing.

### Display Widgets
To display the Widget Blueprint, you must first create a Widget Component for the Widget Blueprint, then you can use the function/event `Add to Viewport` depending on if you are using C++ or Blueprints.

_Blueprint Version_:
1. Place a `Create Widget` node onto the Blueprint graph
2. Select the WBP you want to create a widget for in the _Class_ pin.
3. Drag the Execution pin and connect the `Add to Viewport` node. Also connect the return pin from _Create Widget_ to the target pin of _Add to Viewport_.

_C++ Version_:
1. In the header file of your PlayerController Class, create a `TSubclassOf<UUserWidget> SampleClass` variable. Make it `EditAnywhere`.
2. In the cpp file, include the header `#include "Blueprint/UserWidget.h"`.
3. Use the function `CreateWidget(UObject* OwningObject, TSubclassOf<UUserWidget> UserWidgetClass = WidgetT::StaticClass())` to create the widget. Pass in `this` for _OwningObject_ since the PlayerController is a UObject that can own a widget. Pass in your class variable from step 1 for the _UserWidgetClass_. This function returns a `UUserWidget*`.
4. check if the returned UserWidget from step 3 is nullptr then use the -> operator to find the `AddToViewport()` function.

### Remove Widgets
To remove widgets, use the function `WidgetName->RemoveFromParent()` (deprecated version: `RemoveFromViewport()`).

## Template Functions
`TSubClassOf<type>`
- Used for type safety. Forces designers to use a derived UClass or subclass of set Class. It runs a check on compilation and would return a compile error if the *type* is not a subclass of the specified UClass type.

Why not use `UClass*`?
- With `UClass*`, it is possible to assign the `UClass*` with any UClass rather than only being a set type of UClass. In addition, when assigning the variable, it would do a check at runtime and return a *nullptr* on failure.

Extra information: <https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/why-use-tsubclassof-and-not-just-the-class-itself/365690>

`Cast<type>(object)`
- Used to convert the object within the parenthesis to the type inside of the angle brackets. It is only possible if the type is an inheritance of the object being passed in. Used to get a more specific pointer to a more general one.
- For example, `Cast<APlayerController>(GetController())`. This line returns APlayerController* rather than the generic AController* from GetController().
- Although `Cast<T>(O)` returns a `T*`, the template parameter needs to be just `T`.

`TSoftObjectPtr<type>`
- Used for referencing objects which might or might not be loaded via path. Can point to actors within a level even if they are not loaded. Can be loaded **ASYNCHRONOUSLY** and does **NOT** load its value into memory.

`UWorld::SpawnActor<type>(UClass, Location, Rotation)`
- Used to spawn actors into the world. Using a `TSubclassOf<>` UClass allows you to pass in a BP in for UClass to spawn in actors with all necessary components.
- To use, type `GetWorld()->SpawnActor<>()` or any other var/func that returns a UWorld object.

`TActorRange<type>(UWorld*)`
- `#include EngineUtils.h`
- Iterates over all instances of the _type_ passed in.
- Does not dynamically allocate memory like `UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass()`, since I think it does not return an array.

## Special FX
### Particle Explosions
To add a particle explosion effect to an object, there is a function within `GameplayStatics` that accomplishes this, which is called `SpawnEmitterAtLocation`.

To use it properly, you must have a `UParticleSystem*` variable set with a `UPROPERTY()` macro, and any Blueprint specifiers, in the header file. When compiling and running the solution, the BP with the class should have a new section for particle emitters. 

*_Note: `UParticleSystem` is not a component and is separate from a `UParticleSystemComponent`. 

.h file:
```
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
class UParticleSystem* ExampleParticles;
```

TODO: add reference photo of BP

Function call: `UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(const UObject* WorldContextObject, UParticleSystem* EmitterTemplate, FVector Location, FRotator Rotator = FRotator::ZeroRotator)`

The params included are the main params that would determine where the effect would occur, but there are other params included after the Rotator param that can change the behavior of the effect.

There is another function like the one above called `SpawnEmitterAttached`, which spawns particle effects on a socket that is attaches to a component. It will need a `UParticleSystem*` like the other, but also a `USceneComponent*`, that will be the component it is attaching to, and a `FName` of the socket name.

Function call: `UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAttached(UParticleSystem* EmitterTemplate, USceneComponent* AttachToComponent, FName AttachPointName)`

These are the important params needed to make the particles spawns, at minimum. There are more params included like _Location_, _Rotation_, and others that will affect the particle effect.

### Sounds/Audio
To add sounds to a class, you can declare `USoundBase*` variables with `UPROPERTY(Edit/Anywhere/Defaults)` to set a sound wave file in the BP editor. Then to play the sounds, you can use the `UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation()` function.

Function call for playing sounds: `UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(const UObject* WorldContextObject, USoundBase* Sound, FVector Location, float VolumeMult = 1, float PitchMult)`.

There are only two overloads for this function, and there are additional optional params but these are what I feel to be used/changed in most cases.

Another Function: `UGameplayStatics::SpawnSoundAttached(USoundBase* Sound, USceneComponent* AttachToComponent, FName AttachPointName)`

Similar to SpawnEmitterAttached(), _SpawnSoundAttached()_ will play audio at the location of a socket that is attached to a component. Takes in the same parameters except the first, which takes in a _USoundBase*_.

#### Sound Cue
An asset that can modify the behavior of an audio playback. Very useful for adding variations to your sounds, or tying multiple sounds together.

Some Important nodes:
- **Random**: A node that takes in multiple WAV sounds and randomly chooses one to play.
- **Modulator**: Randomizes the pitch and volume of the inputted sound between a range of two value.

Helpful tips for nodes:
- General tips:
  - Rather than manually adding inputs into a node, you can instead select all sounds you need in the content browser then right click in the editor to see new "\<node name\>: Multiple WAVs" options that automatically set up the nodes for you.
 
#### Attenuation/Spatialization
**Attenuation** is the behavior of sound being loud at close distance and becoming quieter as you are getting far from it. 

**Spatialization** is the behavior of playing a sound to the corresponding speaker from where it was played in game (e.g. when a sound happens to the left of the character, the sound is played on the left side speaker).

Adding these behaviors to our sounds makes the game feel more vibrant and dynamic. In Unreal, most Sound Base assets have an _Attenuation Settings_ tab as part of their settings. To set up that setting, we have to create a **Sound Attenuation Asset** (Naming convention "ATT_Name").

**Sound Attenuation Assets** include tons of settings that can affect the attenuation of sounds, including distance, air absorption, listener focus, and also includes settings for spatialization.

### Camera Shake
As of 07/10/2024, I know how to add camera shake using a BP of class `CameraShakeBase` and attaching that to a C++ based BP.

Within a `CameraShakeBase` BP, there is an option called _Camera Shake Pattern_ in the Details tab. It includes four patters:
- Composite Camera Shake Pattern
- Perlin Noise Camera Shake Pattern
- Sequence Camera Shake Pattern
- Wave Oscillator Camera Shake Pattern

Choose any one of these patterns and tweak them until it fits your desired effect.

Now to apply and use the camera shake, you just have to add a `TSubclassOf<UCameraShakeBase>` variable to the object's C++ class that you want to apply the shake to. Then you can use the Player Controller function `ClientStartCameraShake()` wherever it needs to be applied.

Function call: `APlayerController::ClientStartCameraShake(TSubclassOf<class UCameraShakeBase> Shake, float Scale, ECameraShakePlaySpace PlaySpace, FRotator UserPlaySpaceRot)`

Depending on where you will call the function, you may need to get the Player Controller. This can be done by using `GetWorld()->GetFirstPlayerController()` then using `->ClientStartCameraShake()`.

The most important param here is just the first parameter since that will determine what camera shake is played. The other params have default values so it is okay to leave blank. 

*_Note: As the name suggests, this camera shake is client-side and will only affect the player's screen. To use a camera shake that affects the world, look into `UCameraShakeBase::StartShake()` and do some research._

## Character Animations
### Skeletal Animations
As stated earlier, characters usually have a Skeletal Mesh that is usually used in tandem with a Skeleton, and that these Skeletons can be used for animation. This is called **Skeletal Animation** and reason to use Skeletons for animation is because of how _Bones_ of the Skeleton Tree work. All _Bones_ are their own "component", so they can be edited in a way that each little part can be animated in some way.

Another large benefit of using a Skeleton is that it allows you to tie multiple meshes to the same set of animations on that Skeleton, allowing you to share multiple animations between different meshes.

An example of where Skeletal Animation comes in handy is when you are creating multiple characters with different abilities. Instead of reanimating the basic movements like walking, weapon holding, jumping, etc., you can just use a Skeleton (or subclass a Skeleton) so that those basic movements are shared across characters.

### Animation Blueprints
Blueprints that hold most Animation details and that would enable animations on a character when assigned.

Includes an _Anim Graph_ which looks similar to an Event Graph, which the ABP also has, but has an Output Pose node which will wire the final animation pose to the character. Unlike the normal BP Editor, ABPs do not have a components hierarchy on the left and has two new tabs on the right called "Anim Preview Editor" and "Asset Browser".

TODO: Include photos of ABP Editor

### Blending Character Animations
To blend together animations, there is a node called **Blend** in the Anim Graph, which takes two animation poses and a float as input, and outputs a blend of the poses based on the float (0, all pose A, to 1, all pose B). 

However, this is not the type of blending animations that you may think of when going from one animation to another, such as going from a walk to idle state when releasing the left thumbstick or the W key. This blend, quite literally blends two animations together.

To blend animations in a way that it goes from one state to another, the better method would be to use a `2D Blend Space`.

#### 2D Blend Space
When creating a 2D Blend Space, it creates a new _Animation_ asset. In the Animation Editor, it includes a 2-axis graph in the middle where you can place **multiple** _Animation Sequences_ onto the graph and it will blend the animations based on where the preview node is on the graph.

TODO: add reference photo

A 2D Blend Space is better than the Blend node because the Blend Space can include more than 2 animations, which could cover many different scenarios, with just one Blend Space, as compared to using multiple Blend nodes in multiple sequences. 

#### Blend Animations by Boolean
In the Anim Graph, there is a node called `Blend Poses by Bool` which plays a certain animation/pose depending on the truth value passed in. Good for switching between animations with a simple condition, like "Is Dead?".

### Connecting Animations to Gameplay
#### 2D Blend Space (Variable based)
After creating a 2D Blend Space animation, you can add the BS to you ABP. When placed on the Anim Graph, you can see that the BS takes in two inputs based on the name of the two axis' it was given. The value of the axis' would determine what animation will be played.

To modify these floats, it is best to first create two new float variables (preferrably the same name as the axis' pins) and connecting them to the input pins of the BS.

To edit the new variables based on input, go to the **Event Graph** section of the ABP and there will be two nodes, an Event named _Blueprint Update Animation_ and a fuction called _Try Get Pawn Owner_. Depending on what the BS is accomplishing, you can get some value (i.e. _Get Velocity_ for speed), get its float variation (_Vector Length_ for _Get Velocity_) and then use the _Set_ function for whichever variable to update them. Make sure to connect the execution pin of _Blueprint Update Animation_ to the _Set_ function if not done already.

_*Note: This method does not factor in foot sliding, just general integration. But at face value, it works and depending on how many animations you include in the Blend Space, it can look okay. This is a simple implementation of Animations and Gameplay that can be built upon on._

#### Foot Sliding
To fix foot sliding, you can calculate the speed at which the character moves in the animation. This can be done by checking the "foot" of a character's skeleton in the Animation editor preview and calculating the speed of the foot's animation using this formula:

`foot speed = (y_finish - y_start)/(t_finish - t_start)`

The y coordinate coming from the foot's **WORLD** location and t coming from the time of the action in the animation (the value in the second parentheses of the Animation preview timeline).

To calculate the value, you just use a calculator and note down the values since the main goal is to find the speed and use the value to place the value as the constraints for the axis in the Blend Space editor. If there are multiple moving animations, then each animation would be placed at their respective speeds.

## Blueprints Tips and Tricks
- For node connection management, you can add "Reroute Nodes" from the node menu when Right-Clicking.
- To disconnect a node connection, hold **Ctrl** and **Left-Click** the wire.
- To redirect a node connection, hold **Alt** and hold **Left-Click** on the wire, then drag to new pin.
- If possible, you can take a large section of nodes on the BPE and turn it into a `Function` by either, highlighting the nodes, right-clicking and sending to function, or by adding a new Function by pressing the plus button next to _Functions_ on the left side of the window, and pasting the nodes into the new function.

# Gameplay Logic/Math
This section includes notes I have about certain gameplay logic and math that could be useful in any other engine, not just Unreal Engine. Some names/notes may not be exactly in other engines but an equivalence may be present.

## Transforms
A **Transform** is an object's _Location_, _Rotation_, and _Scale_.
- _Location_: object's position in the (local/global) space.
- _Rotation_: object's angle (tilt).
- _Scale_: object's size.

### Global vs. Local Space
<ins>Global Space</ins>: Refers to the space in which the World is the main object and any object's transform is relative to the World itself.

Example: A character placed in a scene would most likely have the World as its parent making its transform relative to the World, meaning it is being affected in the _Global Space_. Position (0,0,0) of the character would lead to the origin of the World.

<ins>Local Space</ins>: Refers to the space in which a Component is the main object and any other object's transform is relative to that Component.

Example: A torch with a character as its parent makes its transform relative to the character. The torch's transform being relative to the character, rather than the World, is the _Local Space_ that the torch resides in. Meaning that, if the character moves, then the torch moves with it. Position (0,0,0) of the torch would lead to the origin of the character, **NOT** the World.

### Transformation
Transformation is taking a part of the transform of an object, or all of it, and converting the space from Local to Global, and vice-versa.

Types of transformations:
- Position Vector Transform: transforms an object's position/location vector from local space to global space.
- Direction Vector Transform: transforms an object's direction vector from local space to global space.
- Rotator Transform: transforms an object's rotator from local space to global space.
- Inverse Transform: transforms any of the objects transform properties from global space to local space.

# General C++
Section that covers some important, or neat, C++ info that I have missed.

## Virtual Methods
`Virtual Methods` are functions that classes hold that can be overridden by a child class of a parent class. If a child class wants to override a method that the parent class holds, then the method must have _virtual_ in front of it, else an error would occur stating that the same-named function has nothing to override. 

Now these functions are best used with pointers. If you are directly using the class type then you can call the same function and do not need to override. Generally you would use virtual methods if you know that a class is going to be subclassed frequently and that its functions are going to be overridden.

Example:
```
class Gun
{
  public:
  virtual void Fire()
  {
      std::cout << "Bang!" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Launcher : public Gun
{
  public:
  void Fire()
  {
      std::cout << "BOOM!" << std::endl;
  }
};
```
Here is an example class with a child class, here is main with a Gun pointer, pointing to the address of a Gun variable TestGun:
```
int main()
{
  Gun TestGun;

  Launcher TestLauncher;

  Gun* GunPtr;
  GunPtr = &TestGun;
  GunPtr->Fire();
}
```
Running this code would return the line `"Bang!"`. If we were to change the pointer to point to the address of TestLauncher like this:
```
  GunPtr = &TestLauncher;
  GunPtr->Fire();
```
Then the function would return `"BOOM!"` instead. Using a virtual method allows for a process called **Dynamic Dispatching**, in which the compiler would check which version of a virtual function a pointer would call at run time.

Now for this case, since the subclassed function in Launcher does not have the _override_ tag then any mistake with Launcher's Fire() function would lead to the compiler choosing the parent's Fire() function. To add a safety net, attach _override_ to the function in the child classes to make sure that it is overriding an actual method.
```
class Launcher : public Gun
{
  public:
  void Fire() override
  {
      std::cout << "BOOM!" << std::endl;
  }
};
```
Now if there is any problem with Launcher's Fire() function not having the same name as the parent class, or the parent class not having that function, or that the parent class's function not being virtual, then an error would occur now that the child class function has the _override_ tag.
